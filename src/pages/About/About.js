                    Welcome to Aasana AI - your real-time, intelligent yoga companion, designed to help you achieve balance, flexibility, and peace through precise, AI-driven guidance. Our mission is to make the art and science of yoga accessible to everyone, from beginners to seasoned practitioners, using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology that assists, corrects, and supports your yoga journey.

                    Aasana AI is a personal project turned open-source initiative, created with a vision to empower both yoga enthusiasts and developers interested in AI and machine learning. The AI-driven application not only allows users to refine their yoga practice but also serves as a valuable resource for developers who are looking to understand or improve AI-based pose detection. This project is entirely open-source, with all code available on GitHub.

                    1. Pose Detection with Keypoints: Using the powerful, pretrained TensorFlow MoveNet model, aasana AI identifies key body parts and maps their precise coordinates. This process allows us to understand how well a pose is being performed by analyzing the alignment of body parts, making it possible to detect even subtle misalignments.

                    <br></br>
                    2. Classification for Accuracy: After pinpointing the body's key coordinates, a custom-built neural network uses this data to classify poses accurately. This additional model ensures that when a user performs a pose, aasana AI can evaluate and provide real-time feedback if the pose matches the target with over 95% accuracy.
